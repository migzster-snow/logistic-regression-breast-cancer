# Logistic Regression on Breast Cancer Dataset

This project demonstrates the application of **logistic regression** on the [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data) to classify tumors as **malignant** or **benign** based on cell nucleus features.

## üìñ Project Description
Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide, and early detection is crucial. This dataset contains measurements of cell nuclei from breast cancer biopsies. Using logistic regression, we can build a classification model that predicts whether a tumor is malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous).

The dataset includes **569 samples** with **30 numerical features** such as radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, and more. Logistic regression is chosen because it is simple, interpretable, and effective for binary classification.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/migzster-snow/logistic-regression-breast-cancer.git
cd logistic-regression-breast-cancer

# (Optional) Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate         # Windows

# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## üöÄ Usage

Run the logistic regression pipeline:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will:
1. Load and preprocess the dataset.
2. Perform feature scaling with **StandardScaler**.
3. Split the data into training and testing sets.
4. Train a logistic regression classifier.
5. Evaluate model performance with accuracy and classification report.

## üìä Results

- **Accuracy:** ~98.25%

Example classification report:
```
              precision    recall  f1-score   support
           0       0.99      0.98      0.99       108
           1       0.97      0.98      0.98        63
    accuracy                           0.98       171
   macro avg       0.98      0.98      0.98       171
weighted avg       0.98      0.98      0.98       171
```
